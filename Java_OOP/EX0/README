=          Design           =
=============================
I implemented the class according to the instruction, I had a few ideas about how to create the id's of the
book/patron, at first I thought that the Id would be determined by the name (convert each character of the
name to a number) but, I asked in the forum if there is a possibility of two patrons with the same names,
(and the answer was yes)
so this idea won't work well. So eventually I choose that the ID would be determined by the location of the
book/patron in the array (of the library).

=============================
Same answer as in the design section. (implanted as instructed in the question, and explained each function
in the file itself)
